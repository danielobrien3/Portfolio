            <h2>Daniel O'Brien - Software Engineer</h2>
            <p>I am a recently graduated Software Engineer with multiple years of professional experience. I am a tech enthusiast at heart, 
                which has led me down a consfant path of growth in the Computer Science world. I believe that, to humankind in its current state, technology is akin to magic.
                To that end, I believe that a mastery of technogoly opens up a world of endless possibilites. This is the main source of my motivation, and I find every excuse I can to automate
                the mundane tasks I perform on a day-to-day basis.
                As a 2020 graduate, I understand that I have barely scraped the surface of the Software Engineering world. There are new paradigms emerging constantly, and the only way to learn them is through experience. 
                For this reason, my biggest goal is to expand the horizon of Software Engineering issues I must face head on. I am looking for a Software Engineering position that will provide me with these opportunities, and the mentorship necessary to tackle them. With these tools in hand, I feel confident in my abiltity 
                to have a real impact on the world we live in today.

                    <p>Sole Developer of a Full Stack Ruby on Rails League of Legends (eSport) web app. The app scrapes item stats and costs
                    from an API providing item descriptions, and uses these values to calculate how efficient each item is for it’s total
                    in-game cost. The development of this app was done with maintainability at the forefront of my concerns. It boasts
                    clean, easy to utilize class interfaces, and a system that fully updates calculations with each new patch.

                    design decisions. The text-analysis script improved efficiency using a multi-tiered document filter that resulted in a
                    10x increase in process speed.</p>
